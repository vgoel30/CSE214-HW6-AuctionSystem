CSE 214 HW for Hash Tables

##ABOUT
CSE 214 HW for hash tables. <br>The aim was to work with real auction data online and parse the data present in the XML file using the <a href="https://github.com/berry-cs/big-data-cse"> Big Data </a> extraction tool. <br>
Also made use of the serializable interface and worked with the idea of persistence to save auction data between sessions in binary object files.
